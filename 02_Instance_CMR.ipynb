    "Prototype-based implementations of the retrieved context account of memory search generally suppose that learned item and contextual associations are encoded into abstractive prototype representations according to a Hebbian learning process and then retrieved based on activation from a cue. The memory architecture investigated in this paper alternatively supposes that learning episodes are stored as discrete instances in memory and only abstracted over at retrieval. Within previous examples of this architecture [e.g., @hintzman1984minerva; @jamieson2018instance], stored instances are represented as vectors stacked within a $m$ by $n$ memory matrix $M$. In model variations where vectors are not composed of binary values, at retrieval each trace is activated in parallel based on a positively accelerated transformation of its cosine similarity to a probe $p$:\n",

    "Prototypical CMR stores associations between item feature representations (represented a pattern of weights in an item layer $F$) and temporal context (represented in a contextual layer $C$) by integrating prototypical mappings between the representations via Hebbian learning over the course of encoding. In contrast, InstanceCMR tracks the history of interactions between context and item features by storing a discrete record of each experience, even repeated ones, as separate traces within in a memory store for later inspection. Memory for each experience is encoded as a separate row in an $m$ by $n$ memory matrix $M$ where rows correspond to memory traces and columns correspond to features. Each trace representing a pairing $i$ of a presented item’s features $f_i$ and the temporal context of its presentation $c_i$ is encoded as a concatenated vector:\n",

    "The contextual features of the retrieved echo determine contextual input; this retrieved pre-experimental context is normalized to have length 1. Upon retrieval of $c^{IN}$, the current state of context is updated the same way as it is under the prototype-based framework, applying equations [-@eq-4] and [-@eq-5] to drift $c$ toward $c^{IN}$ and enforce its length to 1, respectively.\n",

    "\n",
    "Since item feature representations are presumed to be orthogonal for the purposes of the model, the content of $f_{rec}$ can be interpreted as a measure of the relative support in memory for retrieval of each item $i$, setting the probability distribution of item recalls $P(i)$ to \n",

    "An important difference between equation [-@eq-21] and that applied in our specification of PrototypeCMR to compute $P(i)$ (equation [-@eq-12]) is that $\\tau$ is not applied as an exponent to retrieval supports to shape the contrast between well-supported and poorly supported items. Instead, instance-based models apply this transformation to discrete trace activations before aggregation of an echo representation. This difference still achieves the effect of ultimately either widening or shrinking the difference between item supports driving retrieval, but is not trivial.
