A central task of memory is to relate features of current experience with relevant and useful information from past experience; however, stored information relevant to a probe is often distributed across multiple learning episodes.
To account for our ability to retrieve this information, memory models often specify some mechanism for abstraction -- selective generalization across recurrent features of past experience [@yee2019abstraction].
Abstraction involves identifying and highlighting features common across experiential episodes while disregarding or suppressing more idiosyncratic properties.
Since this capacity is central to how memory systems retrieve relevant information from stored experience, much work has explored how humans carry it out.
